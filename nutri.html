            <h2>Menstruation Phase</h2>
            <p>
                During menstruation, it's important to maintain a balanced diet rich in iron to replenish blood loss.
                Include foods such as leafy greens, lean meats, beans, and fortified cereals in your diet.
                Stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water and herbal teas.

                In the follicular phase, focus on foods that support hormone balance and energy levels.
                Incorporate whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats into your meals.
                Include sources of omega-3 fatty acids like salmon, chia seeds, and walnuts to reduce inflammation.

                During ovulation, prioritize foods that support reproductive health and boost fertility.
                Consume plenty of fruits and vegetables rich in antioxidants, as well as lean proteins like poultry and fish.
                Incorporate dairy or fortified plant-based alternatives for calcium intake.

            <p>
                In the luteal phase, focus on nutrient-dense foods that help alleviate PMS symptoms and support mood stability.
                Include complex carbohydrates like whole grains and legumes to regulate blood sugar levels and reduce cravings.
                Consume foods rich in magnesium, such as nuts, seeds, and dark leafy greens, to ease muscle tension and promote relaxation.
                Additionally, ensure adequate intake of vitamin B6 from sources like poultry, fish, and bananas to support hormone balance.
